# E-Commerce Web Application: A Learning Roadmap

Welcome to this comprehensive guide to building an e-commerce web application using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and microservices architecture. This roadmap is tailored for learners who want to explore the intricacies of modern application development.

## Introduction

This project is a step-by-step guide to developing an e-commerce web application using the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and microservices architecture. The primary goal is to provide a hands-on learning experience, covering the entire development lifecycle, from setting up the infrastructure to deploying a secure, fully-functional application.

## Architecture Overview

Our application architecture is based on the following core principles:

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** Structuring the application around the business domain to ensure a clean and maintainable codebase.
- **Microservices:** Decoupling the application into independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled individually.
- **Event-Driven Communication:** Using Kafka to enable asynchronous communication between services.

Below is a global diagram of the architecture:

## Getting Started

### Mono Repo Approach

We adopt a mono repo approach, which allows us to manage all microservices and related components within a single repository. This simplifies dependency management and ensures consistency across the project.

### Infrastructure and Tools

To set up the project, we'll use the following tools:

- **Spring Boot & Spring Cloud:** For building and managing microservices.
- **Docker & Docker Compose:** For containerization and environment setup.
- **Kafka & Zookeeper:** For handling event-driven communication.
- **Zipkin:** For distributed tracing.
- **Keycloak:** For securing the application.

## Microservices Development

### Configuration Server

We begin by creating a **Configuration Server** that centralizes all configurations for the microservices, ensuring consistent configuration management.

### Discovery Server

Next, we'll set up a **Discovery Server** (using Eureka) to manage service discovery, allowing microservices to locate each other without hardcoded URLs.

### Customer Microservice

The **Customer Microservice** will handle all customer-related operations. This includes:

- Creating customer entities
- Initializing the database
- Implementing customer services

### Product Microservice

The **Product Microservice** manages product data, including:

- Defining product entities
- Setting up the product database
- Implementing CRUD operations for products

### Order Microservice

The **Order Microservice** is responsible for processing customer orders. Key steps include:

- Implementing the 'create order' method
- Handling exceptions
- Integrating with Kafka to manage order confirmations

### Payment Microservice

The **Payment Microservice** manages payment transactions and communicates with the order service to complete order processing.

### Notification Microservice

The **Notification Microservice** sends notifications to customers after successful order processing.

## Event-Driven Architecture

### Kafka & Zookeeper Setup

We will set up **Kafka and Zookeeper** using Docker, enabling asynchronous, event-driven communication between microservices.

### Order Confirmation

Using Kafka, we’ll implement an order confirmation process, where the order service produces messages, and the notification service consumes them.

## API Gateway & Security

### API Gateway

We'll implement an **API Gateway** that routes incoming requests to the appropriate microservices, handling cross-cutting concerns like authentication and logging.

### Security with Keycloak

**Keycloak** will be configured to secure the API Gateway and microservices. This involves:

- Setting up a Keycloak realm and client
- Configuring security for the API Gateway
- Testing the application to ensure security is correctly applied

## Monitoring and Logging

### Zipkin Setup

**Zipkin** will be configured to trace requests across the microservices, helping us monitor and debug the application’s performance.

### Log Management

We'll set up centralized logging to monitor and troubleshoot issues across the application.

## Testing

Finally, we'll test the full application flow, ensuring that all microservices work together seamlessly, with proper security, event handling, and service interactions.

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a complete guide to building a modern e-commerce web application using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and microservices architecture. By following this guide, you'll gain practical experience with essential tools and concepts, laying a solid foundation for your future projects.
